# gw-gravity-forms-custom-js

WordPress Plugin by Gravity Wiz to add Custom JS to Gravity Forms.

The plugin (under GPLv2+) mysteriously disappeared so I'm uploading a backup here.

I found a bug (differences between the legit JS entered and the rendered one)
which may explain why they removed it, and if I find a fix I'll publish it here, but in the meantime: enjoy.
