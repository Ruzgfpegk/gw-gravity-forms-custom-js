# gw-gravity-forms-custom-js

WordPress Plugin by Gravity Wiz to add Custom JS to Gravity Forms.

The plugin (under GPLv2+) mysteriously disappeared so I'm forking it here.

I found a bug (differences between the legit JS entered and the rendered one)
which may explain why they removed it: a fix has been applied in this fork.
