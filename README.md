# gw-gravity-forms-custom-js

WordPress Plugin by Gravity Wiz to add Custom JS to Gravity Forms.

Original URL: https://gravitywiz.com/gravity-forms-custom-javascript/

On December 6th of 2019 I found a bug (differences between the legit JS entered and the rendered one):
a fix has been applied in this fork, and also upstream by the developer on December 19th (v1.4).

This repository is now useless, and will stay as an archive unless other bugs are found.
